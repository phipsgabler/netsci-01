# Network Science - Project 1#

I compared how two different sampling methods (random walk and forest fire) "perform" on two
different data sets (a road network from Texas, and a social graph from Facebook), by comparing
different network measures on the samples.

There is much room for improvement; in fact, the differences could just be due to my implementing
some parts of the algorithms wrong.
